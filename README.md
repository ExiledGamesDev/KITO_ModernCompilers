This is the work of Purring Bytes to make KITO (and IT original code later eventually) compiles into a modern compiler (VS 2022).

Original repository can be found at https://github.com/Impressive-Title-Community-Edition/KITO.

Essential code changes that were needed were found in the repository of DylanCheetah at https://github.com/Cybermals/ImpressiveTitle/tree/master.
Take notes of changes in OgreArchive, OgreFileSystem and also OgreZip.

My changes are licensed under the WTFPL : do what the fuck you want public license.
